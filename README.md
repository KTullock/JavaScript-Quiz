# JavaScript Quiz

## Description

This project allows the user to take a breif quiz about basic JavaScript. This website uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also relies on Web APIs, which lets the user interact directly with the webpage's various elements, such as buttons and a user input form. I learned how Web APIs are used in JavaScript to to target the elements on the page, which allows the user to have a richer experience with the website.
